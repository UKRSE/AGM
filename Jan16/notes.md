## Job descriptions, job adverts, institutional models

* Technical aspects of job descriptions & recruitment
  - Cambridge have been able to influence departmental change process. New role with RSE title. Had some guidelines that had to follow, description compliant with SFIA levels/skill sets (BCS thing). The terminology is too IT oriented, also quite UK centric?
  - Concern that it wouldn’t attract those with research experience who’ve gone through postdocs - description doesn’t look like them.
  - Other places use HERA framework.
  - Distinction between internal JD that institution uses, and job advert.
     * Some places allow these to be different, others require the internal JD to be advertised.
     * You also need to recruit against the criteria in the JD.
     * Person spec, essential & desirable criteria can be more flexible (sometimes?)
  - Similarities in some ways to lab technician, but can’t hire an RSE at that pay scale.
  - Immigration can also be a problem, needing to pay at a particular level. Being in research services means you don’t get a ‘free pass’ on immigration law (resident labour test), unlike hiring a postdoc (it's much easier to pass the test for these). Uni HR may be more picky than home office. For research institutes all staff need to pass the test.
  - Remember that HR/finance staff want to go home at 5pm with minimal hassle - generally don’t want to start something new. Sometimes there are specialist HR staff that will address this better. Can we make their job easier?
  - Show that comparable institutions are already doing it - not a one off. Make an HR toolkit.
  - To get HR to change you need senior academics to lobby, e.g. heads of professional services, PVC/dean for research.
* RSEs are typically recruited either with an IT Services unit/role, or into academic department/role.
  - Institutional structures force you along standard postdoc or standard IT paths - RSE is between these.
  - Manchester group set up in IT Services as it’s the only place to provide a central service. Have RSE as one of the JDs, but with SFIA framework underneath.
  - Can we come up with something that works for RSEs hired under either institutional path?
  - Neither traditional path really works, and this will get worse as the area and need grow - can’t recruit to the positions.
  - Don’t want to force RSE label on people if they actually want a research career (but with strong s/w track).
  - Making explicit split between service role and independence - latter is what is expected from traditional postdoc.
    * Links into metrics.
    * Modern academic community needs expert collaborators, at equivalent status to researchers, not just group leaders.
* Recruiting RSEs to an “academic” role.
  - Should we use a standard postdoc description, or something specifically RSE?
  - Some would like to use postdoc path, but can’t - force into IT Services classification.
  - Others want to highlight that this is different from postdoc, needing different mindset.
  - Does need to be overlap with postdoc domain-specific knowledge, but not identical.
  - Expectation to write papers - although this can be a good thing.
  - Getting hired into a postdoc but actually as a scientific programmer can crush an academic career. Need to show that this isn’t a complete dead end.
* What can we actually do to change this?
  - Pool job adverts that we put out, with commentary on how well they worked, how successful, etc.
  - Provide guidance to those writing JDs/adverts, and what the implications of choices might be.
* Do you need a PhD, or is equivalent experience enough?
  - Means that you understand the research environment.
* Can also advertise PhD positions that include RSE work.
  - Need multiple tiers.
  - If we believe there’s a skill shortage we need to train people into this.
  - Culham do provide trainee roles.
  - Bristol have 4 tiers: PhD equivalent, junior RSE, RSE (senior postdoc equivalent), RSE leader (group leader equivalent). 
* RSE equivalent to jobs.ac.uk? This is already on the RSE website, but issues with history.
  - Do we need guidelines for what can get advertised on there? At least a mention the RSE term?
  - SSI has been doing work on this - talk to Simon.

Resolutions/action items:
* Sharing JDs/adverts publicly (some annotation/commentary is good, maybe on the wiki associated with the repo).
  - A working group should look over these and pull out commonalities etc., linking with that the SSI is doing.
  - A GitHub repo has been created for this.
* Create an HR toolkit.
* Make an archive of RSE-type jobs advertised in the UK.
   - SSI have been scraping jobs.ac.uk for the last year or so


## RSE Champions - Next Steps

1. What is the role of RSE Champion?
- Point of contacts for interested people
- Facilitating and helping with recruitment
- Help with job applications, career path advice
- Being a nucleus for helping RSE people to work with HR
- Working and contacting people in the industiral domain and corporate world: How do we get in touch with them?

2. How much is the workload?
- We don't know yet.
- It is probably within the remit of RSE Fellows.

3. How we want to publishing and promoting the role
- Wepage(s) which has /haven't gone public
- Webpage needs to clarify and provide information: Who provides the input to the webpages? Champions and the community
- There should be common material, core material and more specific material for each institution
- Example of case studies as selling point to new communities, RSE Champions could provide this
- Institutional newsletters
- Sharing proposals

4. Helping and engaging between the champions
- Giving mutual lectures and talks
- Mailing lists (should be perhaps kept to a minimum ?)

Points that came up in the general discussion:

- Email will be sent out to the mailing list informing about the launch of the RSE Champion list.
- Community will be encouraged to speak to their RSE Champion or become one themselves in case their institution is not listed.
- RSE Champion is promoting the role and the campaign, but not the institution.
