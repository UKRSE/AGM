National RSE network â€“ Skills and Resource Sharing

Background
----------
As part of Mike Croucher's fellowship project, three University RSE groups have agreed to contribute a small amount of effort (of the order of 5 days a year each initially) into a brokerage.
Initial participating groups are:-
 * Manchester
 * Sheffield
 * UCL

At this RSE meeting, other groups expressed an interest in contributing to this pool.

First steps
-----------
 * Agreed to start small in the first instance. Things such as:
 	* Invited talks (e.g. Mike Croucher visited southampton to give his talk 'Is your research software correct?' http://mikecroucher.github.io/MLPM_talk/ )
       	* Training days / seminars
       	* Short term consultancy / advice

 * Those who want to participate in these first steps will add to a list of items that they might be able to offer
 * An informal 'record of success' will be kept by any groups who swap effort under this scheme

Ambition
--------
 - To become a national facility
